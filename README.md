# GradientDescentPractice
Part of Introduction to Machine Learning course at Code Heroku which centers around the application of gradient descent algorithm for solving machine learning problems. In this project, hours of new student studying and exam score we the two variables. A relationship between the two was initially transacted and then gradient descent method was used to predict student scores based on hours studies.
